A while ago, I worked on a project that required me to fetch data from Facebook pages. 
The model I built calculated Gail Score for women to estimate their lifetime risk of breast cancer.
Based on the data collected from Facebook pages, which provided me variables such as full name, message, likes count, comments counts and shares_count.
In order to have access to the data from Facebook, I registered to have developer privileges:
Go to [link] (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api) if want to collect data on anything that is available publicly. See [link] (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.7/). Choose any field you want from which you want to extract data such as “pages”

Install package RFacebook, then follow these steps:

my_authorization <- fbOAuth(app_id = "enter your ID here" , app_secret = "secret code enter here")
save(my_authorization , file = "my_authorization")
load("my_authorization")
page.post1 <- getPage(page="ihadcancer", token=my_authorization, n=5000, feed=TRUE)
